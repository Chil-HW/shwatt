@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@cindex purpose
@shwatt{} is an RTL hardware simulator that uses message passing and
promises to treat each cycle as a transaction, letting the
designer/tester ``time-travel'' when building their design.

@node Resources
@chapter Resources
Spritely Institute's @uref{https://spritely.institute/goblins/, Goblins}
project served as the initial inspiration for this project.

@node Style Guidelines
@section Style Guidelines
This project uses
@uref{https://google.github.io/styleguide/lispguide.xml, Google's Common
Lisp style guide} as its guideline.  This document is freely available
online and contains, what I believe, are a good set of default style
points. Please read this document before submitting your changes to
ensure all of your modifications meet this style guide.  If your changes
have a good reason not to follow these guidelines, make sure you
document @emph{why} with appropriate comments.

@node Submitting Patches
@section Submitting Patches
When writing documentation, please use gender-neutral wording when
referring to people, such as
@uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they, singular
``they''@comma{} ``their''@comma{} ``them''}, and so forth.

@quotation Heads Up
Please be sure to test your code with multiple Common Lisp
implementations before submitting your changes!  @shwatt{} is written using
ANSI-compliant Common Lisp, so any conforming implementation should
work.  @shwatt{} is currently tested with @uref{https://www.sbcl.org/, SBCL}
and @uref{https://ccl.clozure.com/, CCL}.

@node Writing Documentation
@section Writing Documentation

To render documentation, you must first make sure that you ran both
@command{./bootstrap} and @command{./configure} in your source tree.
After that you can run one of the following commands:

@itemize
@item @samp{make info} to compile the Info manual.
      You can check it with @command{info doc/shwatt.info}.
@item @samp{make doc/shwatt.info} to compile the Info manual.
      You can check it with @command{info doc/shwatt.info}.
@item @samp{make html} to compile the HTML version.
      You can point your browser to the relevant file in the
      @file{doc/shwatt.html} directory.
@item @samp{make doc/shwatt.html} to compile the HTML version.
      You can point your browser to the relevant file in the
      @file{doc/shwatt.html} directory.
