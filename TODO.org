* Waveform output
  * [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump][VCD (Value Change Dump)]]
    ASCII-based file format.
    Quite inefficient, but VCD is the only standard format for storing digital waveforms from HDL simulations.
  * [[https://blog.timhutt.co.uk/fst_spec/][FST (Fast Signal Trace)]]
    Developed by GtkWave authors to match FSDB (Fast Signal DataBase) from Synopsys' VCS and WLF (Wave Log Format) from Mentor's Questa simulators.
